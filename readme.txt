hyper-tracer 

Kinda like QIRA, but focused on python vs program analysis across all architectures

Under 1.5K lines of code

Python analysis for deep execution and time-travel debugging

Current features:
- Real-time execution tracing
- Variable state tracking
- Memory & CPU profiling
- Function call graphs
- Control & data flow analysis
- Thread monitoring
- Bytecode analysis
- Web Interface for interactive visualization

Future:
 - line-by-line execution viewer 
 - variable state timeline
 - control flow graph visualization
 - memory/cpu usage graphs

 - function execution time profiling
 - I/O operations tracking
 - Breakpoint support 
 - Exception tracking
 - Stack trace visualization

Use cases:
- Debugging complex systems
- Optimizing performance
- Security analysis
